âš¡**Instantly translate the Quran through the lens of your phone.** [future features: enhanced tafseer tools, guided tajweed practice + more!]
<br>
âœ…**Advantages:** Utilises trained Arabic Neural Networks to increase base OCR functionality from 36% to **93%**.  
ðŸš§**Under development:** increasing translation rate -> pushing translation accuracy beyond 93% -> adding UI -> combining with main quran.com repository -> testing -> launch ðŸš€

## Abstract

Most people prefer to have a book in their hands, especially whilst reciting the Quran. However, when it comes to translations, tafseer, and listening to audio, most switch to digital mediums. But, what if there was a hybrid approach to get the best of both worlds? What if you could read an Ayah, pull out your phone to take a picture, and instantly see the meaning of what youâ€™re reading, immerse yourself in deep study of its tafseer, and perfect your tajweed at the same time? To solve this problem, I developed an algorithm whereby a user can snapshot any page of the Quran, an OCR scans the Arabic text utilising a trained Arabic neural network from NanoNets, the OCR result is further refined using my algorithm and finally--utilising Quran.com's API's--a translation of the page is returned in any language from any translator.
